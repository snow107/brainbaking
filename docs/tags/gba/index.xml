      <description>Electrical Engineering students have to work through a programming course in their third year at KU Leuven, a course called &amp;lsquo;Software Design in C/C++&amp;rsquo;. This course is one of the things I inherited from my retired colleague when I started working for the University. As is the case with most programming courses, it&amp;rsquo;s contents was boring as hell.
So, instead of simply making minor adjustments to the syllabus and calling it a day, in the summer of 2018 I decided to throw everything in the begin and start over - hooray, a greenfield project!</description>
