On previous projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on, development PCs came with a local version of the database scheme. Each DB change also got rolled out to those computers, which enabled us developers to fool around without breaking anything on the development (or test) environment. This is another step closer to happiness, at least for our proxy customers who didn&amp;rsquo;t have to reinsert their test data every time we flushed something from a table.</description>

Test Driven Development (or TDD), it&amp;rsquo;s one of those buzz words which usuallly appear in the same sentence with &amp;ldquo;scrum&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;XP&amp;rdquo;. But in practice, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen few people actually applying it all the way through. What do I mean by that? You&amp;rsquo;re probably very familiar with, say Java or .NET, and you know how to write unit tests in that language using your beloved IDE.</description>
