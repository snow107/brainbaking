As I&amp;rsquo;m slowly getting a tiny bit better at drawing things I see, I still don&amp;rsquo;t have a fundamental basis to rely on. Until I&amp;rsquo;ve read &amp;ldquo;Drawing at the right side of the brian&amp;rdquo; from Betty Edwards. Everything I&amp;rsquo;ve read in there came as a complete revelation to me. She explains how you should &amp;ldquo;look&amp;rdquo; at things, what is important to look out for when realisticly drawing and how values/tones work.</description>

I wanted to continue my quest of finding my own style within ink and watercolor boundaries. After the amazing discovery of Skillshare.com, I switched to using Artline fineliners. I also have some Steadlers but hardly notice any difference between different felt tip pens if they have the same thickness. I found a short course by Shirish Deshpande on drawing with ink and creating some contrast and texture.</description>

After the illustration course, I&amp;rsquo;m not ashamed to admit I completely dropped the pencil out of the game. It creates lines easy to remove and that means I&amp;rsquo;m working on a drawing forever. I need something to commit myself to. That something is called ink.
It also seems that I already have stuff to get ink on a paper: pens. Ballpoint pens. Black, blue, whatever.</description>

As you might already have read, I started the drawing adventure with a 10-week &amp;lsquo;illustrative techniques&amp;rsquo; course. It sounds complicated but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t really: it&amp;rsquo;s more of a gentle introduction in different mediums (pencil, ink, acrylic paint, &amp;hellip;) than a crash course in drawing techniques. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know then that to draw illustrations, you still have to be able to draw. (I&amp;rsquo;m reading &amp;ldquo;drawing at the right side of the brain&amp;rdquo; and I know better now).</description>

      <description>Inspired by Noah Bradley&amp;rsquo;s Don&amp;rsquo;t go to art school blog at Medium.com.
Drawing and art in general has always been something I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite grasp or try to understand. I was a software development guy, a technical guy, used to writing code, looking at text, spending days and years in text editors others call IDE&amp;rsquo;s. Software development and art aren&amp;rsquo;t that different actually: they both require an open mindset and an extreme creative approach at solving problems.</description>
