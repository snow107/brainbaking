      <description>Inspired by Noah Bradley&amp;rsquo;s Don&amp;rsquo;t go to art school blog at Medium.com.
Drawing and art in general has always been something I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite grasp or try to understand. I was a software development guy, a technical guy, used to writing code, looking at text, spending days and years in text editors others call IDE&amp;rsquo;s. Software development and art aren&amp;rsquo;t that different actually: they both require an open mindset and an extreme creative approach at solving problems.</description>
