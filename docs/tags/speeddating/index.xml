      <description>Speeddating Contents After the intro everybody is asked to reflect on possible ammeliorations for the working of the team and to choose 1 of them.
Afterwards the speed dating starts. Team members work in pairs in 5 minutes:
 they are asked first to express their appreciation for one another each proposes his/her ammelioration and they have a discussion  Each 5 minutes the team members switch pairs.
