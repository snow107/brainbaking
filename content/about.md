# About Me

Hi, I’m Wouter Groeneveld, and I have a deep passion to inspire others on everything that drives me. I like to think of myself as one of those Rennaissance Men:

> Renaissance man (noun) - a person with many talents or areas of knowledge.

I used to be only good at programming because I thought, as a Master in IT, you specialize instead of generalize. But the more I did with computers, the more my hands itched to do something else. So nowadays I love to go wide and pass on that enthousiasm for knowledge on any level.

Those areas of knowledge include:

#### Software development

* Test your stuff before writing your code! I’m a heavy Test Driven Development (TDD) fanboy and I bark at those who don’t! I teach agile software engineering on multiple occasions, ranging from colleagues to schools.
* I love dynamic languages. I also love converting the haters to the dark side. I teach javascript as a dynamic and functional language - it helps to create your own funky labs to people get more engaged.
* Pair programming used as a tool to learn from each other and to improve code quality are two values I believe in.

#### Baking

* I hold a [professional bread baker's degree](/post/learning-to-become-a-baker/) so naturally I love to think of myself as a real baker. 
* My passion within baking is sourdough, spreading the word by organizing workshops to repopularize it's use. 

#### Writing and philosophizing

* A [fountain pen addict](/post/fountain-pens-first-look/) and avid [journaler](/post/journaling-in-practice/)
* This blog is the ideal base for writing down my thoughts about virtually anything, primarly intended to amuse myself and not others.

#### Drawing

* Starting out to [learn](/post/drawing-week-01) how to use ink other than writing.
