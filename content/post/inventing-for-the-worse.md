People have an irrisistable urge to create. But we often mistake productivity with creativity with **really** creating. Homo creativus. But is this always a good thing? The best inventions in the world bring great sorrow to millions of people today. Then I started wondering, what if...

Electricity wasn't invented? Mass production wouldn't be possible. Everything you use, from your watch to your laptop, stove, to what you're wearing wouldn't be possible. Big grocery stores wouldn't exist. Small specialized shops and professions would reign over the endless army of paper pushers we know today. Wouldn't that be a great thing? Looking past the obvious famine problems and the lack of lights without matches, I would be pretty stoked about:

- The local tailor everybody knows. Your clothes fit and are exactly what you want. But it's very expensive and you can only afford three or four outfits. Another advantage?
- The complete lack of anything "made in China" or "plastic". That would include 3D printers, throwaway garbage, 
- Writing a book with ink.
- Being a craftsman using my hands without asking myself if I should jobhop to the next challenge.

So many things nowadays are simply that: "things". You use them, and if you're bored throw them away. The more I talk to people about anything, the more I'm afraid the throwaway thing is becoming a philosophy: throw your job away if you're bored, throw your wife away if you're bored, 10 things you should to before you die, 7 things you can't miss.
