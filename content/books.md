# Books

I keep an active <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5451893-wouter" target="_blank">Goodreads</a> account where I manage everything I've read and want to read. I invite you to join the community there. Marking a book as read and writing a (short) review never was that satisfying... 

I used to be almost exclusively a fantasy reader. Now I mostly read non-fiction on the most diverse topics, but I do have a soft spot for things like philosophy, art, mindful food and software engineering. 

These are the latest 52 books I've read:
