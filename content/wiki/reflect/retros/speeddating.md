# Speeddating 

### Contents 

After the intro everybody is asked to reflect on possible ammeliorations for the working of the team and to choose 1 of them.

Afterwards the speed dating starts. Team members work in pairs in 5 minutes:

  * they are asked first to express their appreciation for one another
  * each proposes his/her ammelioration and they have a discussion

Each 5 minutes the team members switch pairs.
To conclude all ameliorations are proposed to the group, the most important are chosen and SMART actions for those are fixed.
