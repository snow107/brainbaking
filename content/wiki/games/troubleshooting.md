# Troubleshooting with Booting 

## Raven Shield 

Zie http://www.agr-s.com/forums/index.php?showtopic######383&modethreaded&pid=2624

#### Your CD Key is already being used. 

>This error message indicates one of two things:
>1. If you are on a LAN and another machine on your network is currently playing RVS, you will need to manually change the port that RVS uses to connect to the cd-authorization server. To do this, under the "[R6GameService.R6GSServers]" heading, locate the entry for "m_iCDKeyClientPort=5777" Each computer on the LAN will need to have a unique port number after the 'equals' sign. For example, if you had three computers on the network, you could leave one computer using the port 5777, one using 5776, and the third using 5775.
>2. You cd key is actually being used by another player. Please contact the support office listed in your manual.

## Commandos 3 

#### Wuh? No hotkeys? 

ES! Commandos 3 has hot keys just like Commandos 2 now!

For all if u who complained about the interface, here is your relief!<br/><br/>

Simply put the file in the output folder EX: `C:<br/>Program Files<br/>Commandos 3<br/>Output<br/>`

This was made by the comandos fans in China.

```
V - for the new rifle
Ctrl+S-Quick Save
Ctrl+L-Quick Load
```

.... exactly like commandos 2<br/><br/>
For the hot keys, simply move your mouse on the icons in game to reveal.
